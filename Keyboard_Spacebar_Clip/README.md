# TRS-80 Model 1 - Keyboard Spacebar Clip - 3D Printer

The spacebar clip holds the small metal bar in place to ensure consistent pressure on the button across the spacebar keycap. It also helps to reduce pivoting, thereby decreasing the overall stress on the keycap pin. 

See the assembly instructions below.

Unfortunately, the metal rod is easily lost. Below is also a description of how to recreate the metal rod.

### Print Instructions

- Lay the clip on either of its longer sides.
- Add support for the cross pin and the clip. The support at the cross pin will need to be removed afterward.

### Assembly

![Step 1](Images/IMG_1185_Small.png)

1. Insert the cross pin on the back into either side of the spacebar keycap. Ensure you position the clip towards the top of the spacebar keycap, as the keycap is more slanted at the top than at the bottom.

2. Press firmly on the largest flat areas of the clip on either side. Do not press on the clip itself, as it may crack from the pressure.

## Metal Rod

1. Cut a 1.6mm rod to a length of 152mm.
2. Make marks with a pencil on the rod on either side at 16mm and 10mm.
3. Bend one end of the rod at the 10mm mark 90 degrees, in any direction. Ideally, use a heavy-duty needle nose plier and bend just right before the mark. That way the bend will extend beyond the 10mm mark as expected with the measurement. The bend starts at 10mm.
4. Bend the next 90 degrees back in the same direction the rod was originally heading at the 16mm mark. Do the same as bfore: start bending it right before the mark.
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other side as well, but make sure the rod stays flat overall. The central part of the metal rod will have a length of about 120 mm.

**Note**: Ensure that the metal rod lies somewhat flat when placed on a table. You can twist the bends slightly to correct their direction, making them flat.

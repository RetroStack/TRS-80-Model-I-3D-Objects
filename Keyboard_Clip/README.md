### Disassembly

Simply press the two flaps together and push it out. You can also use something small (round-ish) to push against the square plastic tab.

### Assembly

- Feed the item from the top into the keyboard shield. Both go in the same orientation on either side of the keyboard spacebar.
- Make sure the square tab is oriented with the hole.
- Keep pushing in until the two flabs click in place.

**NOTE**: The square tab is there to ensure orientation. Make sure to lower it straight down.

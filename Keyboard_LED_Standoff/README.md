### Assembly

**NOTE**: Use a 5mm LED!

![Step 1](Images/IMG_1215_Small.png)

1. The top hole has one side with a straight edge. That is where the flat side of the LED head sits. The round parts should snugly fit into the hole and rest on the ring inside.
2. When pushing the LED all the way through, make sure the legs are separated into each side of the split in the tube.

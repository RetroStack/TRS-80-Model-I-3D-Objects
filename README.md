# TRS-80 Model 1 - Parts

This project includes various items that were part of a TRS-80 Model 1 and have been replicated for 3D printing. Over time, things get lost or break, and this repository was created to provide a way to recover these lost items. The entire project is available under the MIT license.

Below is a list of available items, each with a link to a more detailed description and the STL file. If there is an item missing that you need, see the note at the end of this file.

NOTE: There are three types of covers used: small, medium, and large. I only have the medium, and therefore, only that was digitized.

## Missing Item?

It seems like an item you need is missing. If so, you can request it on my Patreon page (see below). However, if I do not have the item myself, then I won't be able to digitize it.
